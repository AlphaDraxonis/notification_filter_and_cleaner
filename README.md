<h1>Notification Filter and Cleaner</h1>

<p><strong>Notification Filter and Cleaner</strong> is a lightweight Android app designed to automatically remove specific push notifications. Using a NotificationListener, the app evaluates each incoming notification and removes it from the status bar if it meets one of your specified conditions, preventing unnecessary clutter in your status bar.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The idea for Notification Filter and Cleaner originated from dealing with the persistent and irrelevant notification "Your Village is being raided" in Clash of Clans that can easily appear dozens of times per day. Despite feedback from players, the developers did not address this issue. That's why I took things into my own hand, creating Notification Filter and Cleaner to give users control over which notifications they see. Note that notifications with sound will still make a sound, even if they are removed shortly afterwards.</p>

<h2>Why Use Notification Filter and Cleaner?</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Selective Removal:</strong> Unlike many apps that only offer actions like snoozing or muting, Notification Filter and Cleaner can completely remove unwanted game notifications as if they never arrived, without blocking other notifications from the same app.</li>
    <li><strong>Free and Open Source:</strong> Enjoy full functionality 100% for free with no ads or data collection. The open-source nature ensures transparency.</li>
    <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Designed to run efficiently in the background with minimal impact on your device’s resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re frustrated with persistent game notifications that you can’t fully disable because you still want some notifications, Notification Filter and Cleaner offers a straightforward solution to help manage your notification experience.</p>

<p>Android 7.0 or higher is required.</p>
